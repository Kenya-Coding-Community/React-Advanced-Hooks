It's important to understand that hooks are basically just functions.
ðŸ’ŽHooks : âœ¨ The Hooks API consists of two fundamental and primary hooks which are mentioned below.
In addition to these fundamental hooks, there are a number of auxiliary hooks which can be used for advanced behaviour.
Let's see one by one : 
1- useState.
2- useEffect. 
3- useReducer. 
4- useCallback.
5- useMemo. 
6- useRef. 
7- useImperativeHandle. 
8- useLayoutEffect. 
9- useDebugValue.
