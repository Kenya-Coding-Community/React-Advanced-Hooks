It's important to understand that hooks are basically just functions.
ðŸ’ŽHooks : âœ¨ The Hooks consists of two fundamental and primary hooks which are mentioned below.
In addition to these fundamental hooks, there are a number of auxiliary hooks which can be used for advanced behaviour.
Let's see one by one : 
- useState.
- useEffect. 
- useReducer. 
- useCallback.
- useMemo. 
- useRef. 
- useImperativeHandle. 
- useLayoutEffect. 
- useDebugValue.
### Topic: Discussing Hooks
#### useState
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'; 
```
useState returns a pair, the current state value and a function, that lets you change the state.

useState takes one argument, which is the initial value of the state.

example.

```jsx
function Hello() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("David");

  return <h1>Hello {name}.</h1>;
}
```
In the example above, we create a name state variable and a setName function. The square brackets syntax is called array destructuring. It assigns the name variable to the current state value, and setName to the function that allows to change the state. You can name these variables anything you like.
Then, we pass "David" as the initial value for our name variable to useState().
