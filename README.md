It's important to understand that hooks are basically just functions.
ðŸ’ŽHooks : âœ¨ The Hooks consists of two fundamental and primary hooks which are mentioned below.
In addition to these fundamental hooks, there are a number of auxiliary hooks which can be used for advanced behaviour.
Let's see one by one : 
- useState.
- useEffect. 
- useReducer. 
- useCallback.
- useMemo. 
- useRef. 
- useImperativeHandle. 
- useLayoutEffect. 
- useDebugValue.
### Topic: Discussing Hooks
#### useState

First, we need to import the useState hook:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'; 
```
useState returns a pair, the current state value and a function, that lets you change the state.

useState takes one argument, which is the initial value of the state.

example.

```jsx
function Hello() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("David");

  return <h1>Hello {name}.</h1>;
}
```
In the example above, we create a name state variable and a setName function. The square brackets syntax is called array destructuring. It assigns the name variable to the current state value, and setName to the function that allows to change the state. You can name these variables anything you like.
Then, we pass "David" as the initial value for our name variable to useState().

#### useEffect
useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.


```jsx
useEffect(setup, dependencies?)
```
useEffect is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You canâ€™t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a new component and move the state into it.

Call useEffect at the top level of your component to declare an Effect:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);
  // ...
}
```
